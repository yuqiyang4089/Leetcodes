   matches the sequence of characters in the String.

Internal class dictionary:
1.StringBuffer[] sb = new StringBuffer[nRows];
  StringBuffer is a peer class of String that provides much of the
  functionality of strings. String represents fixed-length, immutable
  character sequences while StringBuffer represents growable and writable
  character sequences.
  eg:  sb[1].append(x);
  eg: length = sb.length();
